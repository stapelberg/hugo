<p>
I recently worked on the following RC bugs:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/694892">#694892 — tvtime: package installation creates /root/.tvtime</a><br>
Sent a patch which fixes the issue. Needs a second pair of eyes plus possibly
an NMU.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/684604">#684604 — eclipse-rcp: eclipse 3.8 hangs on splash screen with "Loading Workbench" after update from 3.7.2</a><br>
Pinged reporter(s) about test files which are offline by now.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/673790">#673790 — python-prettytables: Broken API on new version</a><br>
Investigated the current state, then re-assigned the bug to the only
still-broken package python-cloudservers. People who (can) use
python-cloudservers and want to change it to the current python-prettytables
API can help here.
</li>

</ul>
</p>
