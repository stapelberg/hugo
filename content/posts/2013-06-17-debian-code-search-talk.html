<p>
At this year’s <a href="http://gulas.ch/">GPN13</a> I gave a talk about Debian
Code Search. It was in German, so I spent a few hours creating english
subtitles.
</p>

<p>
You can watch the video at <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6DtW3zCTvk">youtube.com/watch?v=n6DtW3zCTvk</a>
with english subtitles.
</p>

<p>
In case you prefer to download the file(s), get <a
href="http://ftp.ccc.de/events/gpn/gpn13/gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4">http://ftp.ccc.de/events/gpn/gpn13/gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4</a>
(84 MiB) and the corresponding subtitle file at <a
href="http://t.zekjur.net/gpn13-debian-code-search.srt">http://t.zekjur.net/gpn13-debian-code-search.srt</a>.
Drop both files in the same directory, run <code>mplayer
gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4</code> and press v to enable subtitles.
I intend to eventually put the (subtitled) video on YouTube and refer to it
from <a href="http://codesearch.debian.net/">codesearch.debian.net</a>, but I
wanted to post the video in its current form already.
</p>

<p>
The presentation itself explains the motivation behind Debian Code Search and
how it works. You don’t need any knowledge of the system in order to understand
the talk. Enjoy!
