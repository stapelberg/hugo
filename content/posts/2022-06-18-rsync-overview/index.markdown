For many years, I was only a casual user of
[rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) and used it mostly for one-off file
transfers.

Over time, I found rsync useful in more and more cases, and would recommend
every computer user put this great tool into their toolbox 🛠 🧰 !

I’m publishing a series of blog posts about rsync:

* [rsync, article 1: Scenarios](../2022-06-18-rsync-article-1-scenarios/). To
  motivate why it makes sense to look at rsync, I present three scenarios for
  which I have come to appreciate rsync: DokuWiki transfers, Software deployment
  and Backups.
* rsync, article 2: Surroundings (To be published). Now that we know what to use
  rsync for, how can we best integrate rsync into monitoring and alerting, and
  on which operating systems does it work?
* rsync, article 3: How does rsync work? (To be published). With rsync up and
  running, it’s time to take a peek under the hood of rsync to better understand
  how it works.
* rsync, article 4: My own rsync implementation (To be published.)
