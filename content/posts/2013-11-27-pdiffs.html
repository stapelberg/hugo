<a href="http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2013/11/27-pdiffs/">Richi’s post
about the pdiff-by-default agony</a> resonates with me a lot.
</p>

<p>
On <strong>EVERY</strong> Debian installation I have ever done in the last few
years, without any exceptions, I have turned off pdiffs. Even on all the
oddball cases (Raspberry Pi, account on a remote machine, …) where I don’t run
my install-configs script, I have ended up turning off pdiffs eventually,
because it is just so insanely slow on modern internet connections. And by
modern I mean even the DSL link my parents’ place has since 14 years.

<p>
Let’s disable pdiffs by default already.
