<p>
I recently worked on the following RC bugs:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/691125">#691125 — ejabberd: package installation creates /root/.erlang.cookie</a><br>
I tracked down the cause of this and provided a patch. Now I also know how
piuparts works in detail :-).
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/691180">#691180 — connman: Connman won't run due to missing libxtables.so.7</a><br>
Since this bug does not affect testing and it doesn’t look like iptables
1.4.16.3-1 (a new upstream release) will go into wheezy (no freeze unblock
filed), I tagged this with wheezy-ignore. I hope this was right, if not, feel
free to correct me.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/684645">#684645 — liblockfile1: Order of fcntl and dotlock in maillock</a><br>
I identified the piece of code which does locking the wrong way. Since I’m not
familiar enough with either sendmail or NFS-safe locking, I did not send a
patch. In case you have experience with this, please have a look!
</li>

</ul>
