title: "pk4: a new tool to avail the Debian source package producing the specified package"

<p>
  UNIX distributions used to come with the system source code
  in <code>/usr/src</code>. This is a concept which fascinates me: if you want
  to change something in any part of your system, just make your change in the
  corresponding directory, recomile, reinstall, and you can immediately see your
  changes in action.
</p>

<p>
  So, I decided I wanted to build a tool which can give you the impression of
  that, without the downsides of additional disk space usage and slower update
  times because of <code>/usr/src</code> maintenance.
</p>

<p>
  The result of this effort is a tool called <code>pk4</code> (mnemonic: get me
  the package for…) which I just uploaded to Debian.
</p>

<p>
  What distinguishes this tool from an <code>apt source</code> call is the
  combination of a number of features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    pk4 defaults to the version of the package which is installed on your
    system. This means when installing the resulting packages, you won’t be
    forced to upgrade your system in case you’re not running the latest
    available version.
    <br>
    In case the package is not installed on your system, the candidate
    (see <code>apt policy</code>) will be used.
  </li>
  <li>
    pk4 tries hard to resolve the provided argument(s): you can specify Debian
    binary package names, Debian source package names, or file paths on your
    system (in which case the owning package will be used).
  </li>
  <li>
    pk4 comes with tab completion for bash and zsh.
  </li>
  <li>
    pk4 caps the disk usage of the checked out packages by deleting the oldest ones
    after crossing a limit (default: 2GiB).
  </li>
  <li>
    pk4 allows users to enable supplied or shipped-with-pk4 hooks, e.g. git-init.
    <br>
    The git-init hook in particular results in an experience that reminds of
    <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/dgit/dgit.1.en.html">dgit</a>,
    and in fact it might be useful to combine the two tools in some way.
  </li>
  <li>
    pk4 optimizes for low latency of each operation.
  </li>
  <li>
    pk4 respects your APT configuration, i.e. should work in company intranets.
  </li>
  <li>
    tries hard to download source packages, with fallback to snapshot.debian.org.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you don’t want to wait for the package to clear the NEW queue, you can get
  it from here in the meantime:
</p>
<pre>
wget https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/pk4/pk4_1_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./pk4_1_amd64.deb
</pre>

<p>
  You can find the sources and issue tracker
  at <a href="https://github.com/Debian/pk4">https://github.com/Debian/pk4</a>.

  Here is a terminal screencast of the tool in action, availing the sources of
  i3, applying a patch, rebuilding the package and replacing the installed
  binary packages:
