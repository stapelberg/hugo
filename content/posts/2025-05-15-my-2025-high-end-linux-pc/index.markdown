{{< note >}}

**Update (2025-09-07):** The replacement CPU also died and I have given up on
Intel. See [Bye Intel, hi AMD!](/posts/2025-09-07-bye-intel-hi-amd-9950x3d/) for
more details on the AMD 9950X3D.

{{< /note >}}

Turns out [my previous attempt at this build had a faulty
CPU!](/posts/2025-03-19-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-on-asus-z890-not-stable/) With
the CPU replaced, the machine now is stable and fast! üöÄ In this article, I‚Äôll
go into a lot more detail about the component selection, but in a nutshell, I
picked an Intel 285K CPU for low idle power, chose a 4TB SSD so I don‚Äôt have to
worry about running out of storage quickly, and a capable nvidia graphics card
to [drive my Dell UP3218K 8K monitor](/posts/2017-12-11-dell-up3218k/).

Total: 2350 CHF

‚Ä¶and the next couple of sections go into detail on how I selected these components.

### Case

I have been a fan of Fractal cases for a couple of generations. In particular, I
realized that the ‚ÄúCompact‚Äù series offers plenty of space even for large
graphics cards and CPU coolers, so that‚Äôs now my go-to case: the Fractal Define
7 Compact (Black Solid).

My general requirements for a PC case are as follows:

1. No extra effort should be required for the case to be as quiet as possible.
1. The case should not have any sharp corners (no danger of injury!).
1. The case should provide just enough space for easy access to your components.
1. The more support the case has to encourage clean cable routing, the better.
1. USB3 front panel headers should be included.

I really like building components into the case and working with the case. There
are no sharp edges, the mechanisms are a pleasure to use and the
cable-management is well thought-out.

The only thing that wasn‚Äôt top-notch is that Fractal ships the case screws in
sealed plastic packages that you need to cut open. I would have wished for a
re-sealable plastic baggie so that one can keep the unused screws instead of
losing them.

With this build, I have standardized all my PCs into Fractal Define 7 Compact
Black cases!

### Power Supply

I wanted to keep my options open regarding upgrading to an nvidia 50xx series
graphics card at a later point. Those models have a TGP (‚ÄúTotal Graphics Power‚Äù)
of 575 watts, so I needed a power supply that delivers enough power for the
whole system even at peak power usage in all dimensions.

I ended up selecting the Corsair RM850x, which [reviews favorably (‚Äúleader in
the 850W gold
category‚Äù)](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-rm850x-2021-power-supply-review)
and was available at my electronics store of choice.

This was a good choice: the PSU indeed runs quiet, and I really like the power
cables (e.g. the GPU cable) that they include: they are very flexible, which
makes them easy to cable-manage.

One interesting realization was that it‚Äôs more convenient to not use the PSU‚Äôs
12VHPWR cable, but instead stick to the older 8-pin power connectors for the GPU
in combination with a 12VHPWR-to-8-pin adapter. The reason is that the 12VHPWR
connector‚Äôs locking mechanism is very hard to unlock, so when swapping out the
GPU (as I had to do a number of times while trouble-shooting), unlocking an
8-pin connector is much easier‚Ä¶

### SSD disk

I have been avoiding PCIe 5 SSDs so far because they consume a lot more power
compared to PCIe 4 SSDs. While bulk streaming data transfer rates are higher on
PCIe 5 SSDs, random transfers are not significantly faster. Most of my compute
workload are random transfers, not large bulk transfers.

The power draw situation with PCIe 5 SSDs seems to be getting better lately,
with the Phison E31T being the first controller that implements power saving. A
disk that uses the E31T controller is the Corsair Force Series MP700
Elite. Unfortunately, said disk was unavailable when I ordered.

Instead, I picked the Samsung 990 Pro with 4 TB. I have had good experiences
with the Samsung Pro series over the years (never had one die or degrade
performance), and my previous 2 TB disk was starting to fill up, so the extra
storage space is appreciated.

### Onboard 2.5GbE Network Card

One annoying realization is that most mainboard vendors seem to have moved to
2.5 GbE (= 2.5 Gbit/s ethernet) onboard network cards. I would have been
perfectly happy to play it safe and buy another Intel I225 1 GbE network card,
as long as it *just works* with Linux.

In the 2.5 GbE space, the main players seem to be Realtek and Intel. Most
mainboard vendors opted for Realtek as far as I could see. 

Linux includes the `r8169` driver for Realtek network cards, but whether the
card will work out of the box depends on the exact revision of the network card!
For example:
* The AsRock Z890 Pro-A has rev 8125B. lshw:
`firmware=rtl8125b-2_0.0.2 07/13/20`
* The ASUS PRIME Z890-P has rev 8125**D**. lshw:
  `firmware=rtl8125d-1_0.0.7 10/15/24`

For revision 8125D, you need a recent-enough Linux version (6.13+) that includes
commit ‚Äú[r8169: add support for
RTL8125D](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f75d1fbe7809bc5ed134204b920fd9e2fc5db1df)‚Äù,
accompanied by a recent-enough linux-firmware package. 

Even with the latest firmware, there is some concern around stability and ASPM
support. See for example [this ServerFault
post](https://serverfault.com/a/1169558) by someone working on the `r8169`
driver. But, despite the Intel 1 GbE options being well-supported at this point,
Intel‚Äôs 2.5 GbE options might not fare any better than the Realtek ones: I found
[reports of instability with Intel‚Äôs 2.5 GbE network
cards](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeServer/comments/1cc0yuq/are_intel_25_gbe_nics_i225v_i226v_stable_now/).

That said, aside from the annoying firmware requirements, the Realtek 2.5 GbE
card seems to work fine for me in practice.

### Mainboard

Despite the suboptimal network card choice, I decided to stick to the ASUS PRIME
series of mainboards, as I made good experiences with those in my past few
builds. Here are a couple of thoughts on the ASUS PRIME Z890-P mainboard I went
with:

* I like the quick-release PCIe mechanism: ASUS understood that people had
  trouble unlocking large graphics cards from their PCIe slot, so they added a
  lever-like mechanism that is easily reachable. In my couple of usages, this
  worked pretty well!
* I wrote about [slow boot times with my 2022 PC
  build](/posts/2022-01-15-high-end-linux-pc/#slow-boot) that were caused by
  time-consuming memory training. On this ASUS board, I noticed that the board
  blinks the Power LED to signal that memory training is in progress. Very nice!
  It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me previously that the various phases of the boot could
  be signaled by different Power LED blinking patterns :)
  * The downside of this feature is: While the machine is in suspend-to-RAM, the
    Power LED also blinks! This is annoying, so I might just disconnect the
    Power LED entirely.
* The UEFI firmware includes what they call a Q-Dashboard: An overview of what
  is installed/connected in which slot. Quite nice:

{{< img src="IMG_4809.jpg" >}}

One surprising difference between the two mainboards I tested was that the
AsRock Z890 Pro-A does not seem to report the correct DIMM clock in `lshw`,
whereas the ASUS does:

I haven‚Äôt checked if there are measurable performance differences (e.g. if the
XMP profile is truly active), but at least you now know to not necessarily trust
what `lshw` can show you.

### CPU fan

I am a long-time fan of Noctua‚Äôs products: This company makes silent fans with
great cooling capacity that work reliably! For many years, I have swapped out
all the fans of each of my PCs with Noctua fans, and it was always an
upgrade. Highly recommended.

Hence, it is no question that I picked the latest and greatest Noctua CPU cooler
for this build: the Noctua NH-D15 G2. There are a couple of things to pay
attention to with this cooler:

* I decided to configure it with one fan instead of two fans: Using only one fan
  will be the quietest setup, yet still have plenty of cooling capacity for this
  setup.
* There are 3 different versions that differ in how their base plate is
  shaped. Noctua recommends: ‚ÄúFor LGA1851, we generally recommend the regular
  standard version with medium base convexity‚Äù
  (https://noctua.at/en/intel-lga1851-all-you-need-to-know)
* With a height of 168 mm, this cooler fits well into the Fractal Define 7
  Compact Black.

### CPU and GPU: Idle Power vs. Peak Performance

#### CPU choice: Intel over AMD

Probably the point that raises most questions about this build is why I selected
an Intel CPU over an AMD CPU. The primary reason is that Intel CPUs are so much
better at power saving!

Let me explain: Most benchmarks online are for gamers and hence measure a usage
curve that goes ‚Äústart game, run PC at 100% resources for hours‚Äù. Of course,
when you never let the machine idle, you would care about *power efficiency*:
how much power do you need to use to achieve the desired result?

My use-case is software development, not gaming. My usage curve oscillates
between ‚Äúbarely any usage because Michael is reading text‚Äù to ‚Äúcomplete this
compilation as quickly as possible with all the power available‚Äù. For me, I need
both absolute power consumption at idle, and absolute performance to be
best-of-class.

AMD‚Äôs CPUs offer great performance (the recently released [Ryzen 9 9950X3D is
even faster](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-linux) than the
Intel 9 285K), and have great *power efficiency*, but poor *power consumption*
at idle: With ‚âà35W of idle power draw, Zen 5 CPUs consume ‚âà3x as much power as
Intel CPUs!

Intel‚Äôs CPUs offer great performance (like AMD), but excellent power consumption
at idle.

Therefore, I can‚Äôt in good conscience buy an AMD CPU, but if you want a fast
gaming-only PC or run an always-loaded HPC cluster with those CPUs, definitely
go ahead :)

#### Graphics card: nvidia over AMD

I don‚Äôt necessarily recommend any particular nvidia graphics card, but I have
had to stick to nvidia cards because they are the only option that work with my
picky [Dell UP3218K monitor](/posts/2017-12-11-dell-up3218k/).

From time to time, I try out different graphics cards. Recently, I got myself an
AMD Radeon RX 9070 because I read that it works well with open source drivers.

While the Radeon RX 9070 works with my monitor (great!), it seems to consume 45W
in idle, which is much higher than my nvidia cards, which idle at ‚âà 20W. This is
unacceptable to me: Aside from high power costs and wasting precious resources,
the high power draw also means that my room will be hotter in summer and the
fans need to spin faster and therefore louder.

People asked me on Social Media if this could be a measurement error (like, the
card reporting inaccurate values), so I double-checked with a [myStrom WiFi
Switch](https://mystrom.ch/de/wifi-switch/) and confirmed that with the Radeon
card, the PC indeed draws 20-30W more from the wall socket.

#### Why Low Idle Power is so important

In the comments for my [my previous blog post about the first build of this
machine not running
stable](/posts/2025-03-19-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-on-asus-z890-not-stable/),
people were asking why it is worth it to optimize a few watts of power
usage. People calculate what higher power usage might cost, put it in relation
to the total cost of the components, and conclude that saving ¬±10% of the price
can‚Äôt possibly be worth the effort.

Let me try to illustrate the importance of low idle power with this anecdote:
For one year, I was suffering from an nvidia driver bug that meant the GPU would
not clock down to the most efficient power-saving mode (because of the high
resolution of my monitor). The 10-20W of difference should have been
insignificant. Yet, when the bug was fixed, I noticed how my PC got quieter
(fans don‚Äôt need to spin up) and my room noticeably cooled down, which was great
as it was peak temperatures in summer.

To me, having a whisper-quiet computing environment that does not heat up my
room is a great, actual, real-life, measurable benefit. Not wasting resources
and saving a tiny amount of money is a nice cherry on top.

Obviously all the factors are very dependent on your specific situation: Your
house‚Äôs thermal behavior might differ from mine, your tolerance for noise
(and/or baseline noise levels) might be different, you might put more/less
weight on resource usage, etc.

## Installation

### UEFI setup

On the internet, I read that there was some issue related to the Power Limits
that mainboards come with by default. Therefore, I did a [UEFI firmware
update](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/prime/prime-z890-p/helpdesk_bios?model2Name=PRIME-Z890-P)
immediately after getting the mainboard. I upgraded to version 1404 (2025/01/10)
using the provided ZIP file (`PRIME-Z890-P-ASUS-1404.zip`) on an MS-DOS
FAT-formatted USB stick with the EZ Flash tool in the UEFI firmware
interface. Tip: do not extract the ZIP file, otherwise the EZ Flash tool cannot
update the Intel ME firmware. Just put the ZIP file onto the USB disk as-is.

I verified that with this UEFI version, the `Power Limit 1 (PL1)` is 250W, and
`ICCMAX=347A`, which are exactly the values that Intel recommends. Great!

I also enabled XMP and verified that memtest86 reported no errors.

### Software setup: early adopter pains

To copy over the data from the old disk to the new disk, I wanted to boot a live
linux distribution (specifically, [grml.org](https://grml.org/)) and follow my
usual procedure: boot with the old disk and the new (empty) disk, then use `dd`
to copy the data. It‚Äôs nice and simple, hard to screw up.

Unfortunately, while grml 2024.12 technically does boot up, there are two big
problems:

1. There is no network connectivity because the kernel and linux-firmware
   versions are too old.

    * Kernel commit [r8169: add support for
      RTL8125D](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/f75d1fbe7809bc5ed134204b920fd9e2fc5db1df)
      is not included.

1. I could not get Xorg to work at all. Not with the Intel integrated GPU, nor
   with the nvidia dedicated GPU. Not with `nomodeset` or any of the other
   options in the grml menu. This wasn‚Äôt merely a convenience problem: I needed
   to use `gparted` (the graphical version) for its partition moving/resizing
   support.

Ultimately, it was easier to upgrade my old PC to Linux 6.13 and linux-firmware
20250109, then put in the new disk and copy over the installation.

### TRIM your SSDs

SSD disks can degrade over time, so it is essential that the Operating System
tells the SSD firmware about freed-up blocks (for wear leveling). When using
full-disk encryption, all involved layers need to have TRIM support enabled.

I think I saw the effect of an incorrectly configured TRIM setup in action back
in 2022, [when I copied my data from a Force MP600 to a WD Black
SN850](/posts/2022-01-15-high-end-linux-pc/#copying-the-data), which
unexpectedly took many hours!

To make sure my disk has a long and healthy life, I double-checked that both
[periodic and continuous TRIM are
enabled](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Solid_state_drive) on my Arch Linux
system: The {{< man name="fstab" section="5" >}} file contains the `discard`
option (and {{< man name="mount" section="8" >}} lists the `discard` option),
and `fstrim.service` ran within the last week:

```
systemd[1]: Starting Discard unused blocks on filesystems from /etc/fstab...
fstrim[779617]: /boot: 10.1 GiB (10799427584 bytes) trimmed on /dev/nvme0n1p1
fstrim[779617]: /: 1.8 TiB (2018906263552 bytes) trimmed on /dev/mapper/cryptroot
systemd[1]: fstrim.service: Deactivated successfully.
```

Speaking of copying data: the transfer from my WD Black SN850 to my Samsung 990
PRO ran at 856 MB/s and took about 40 minutes in total.

## Performance

Here are the total times for a couple of typical workloads I run:

The performance boost is great! Building Linux kernels a whole minute faster is
really nice.

## Stability issues

In March, I published [an article about how the first build of this machine was
not stable](/posts/2025-03-19-intel-core-ultra-9-285k-on-asus-z890-not-stable/),
in which you can read in detail about the various crashes I ran into.

Now, in early May, I know for sure that the CPU was defective, after a lengthy
trouble-shooting in which I swapped out **all** the other parts of this PC, sent
back the CPU and got a new one.

The CPU was the most annoying component to diagnose in this build because it‚Äôs
an LGA&nbsp;1851 socket and I don‚Äôt (yet) have any other machines which uses
that same socket. AMD‚Äôs approach of sticking to each socket for a longer time
would have been better in this situation.

### Stress testing

When I published my earlier blog post about the PC being unstable, I did not
really know how to reliably trigger the issue. Some compute-intensive tasks like
running a Django test suite seemed to trigger the issue. I *suspect* that the
problem somehow got worse, because when I started stress testing the machine,
suddenly it would crash **every time** when building a Linux kernel.

That got me curious to see if other well-known CPU stress testers like
[Prime95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime95) would show problems, and
indeed: within seconds, Prime95 would report errors.

I figured I would use Prime95 as a quick signal: if it reports errors, the
machine is faulty. This typically happens within seconds of starting Prime95.

If Prime95 reported no errors, I would use Linux kernel compilation as a slow
signal: if I can successfully build a kernel, the machine is likely stable
enough.

The specific setup I used is to run `./mprime -m`, hit N (do not participate in
distributed computation projects), then Enter a few times to confirm the
defaults. Eventually, Prime95 starts calculating, which pushes the CPU to 100%
usage (see the {{< man name="dstat" section="1" >}}-like output by my
[`gokrazy/stat`](https://github.com/gokrazy/stat) implementation) and draws the
expected ‚âà300W of power from the wall:

{{< img src="IMG_5271.jpg" alt="photo of running Prime95 to stress-test a CPU" >}}

{{< img src="2025-05-04-power.jpg" alt="screenshot of PC power usage" >}}

In addition, I also ran [MemTest86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MemTest86) for
a few hours:

{{< img src="IMG_4821.jpg" alt="photo of running memtest86" >}}

To be clear: I also successfully ran MemTest86 on the previous, unstable build,
so only running MemTest86 is not good enough if you are dealing with a faulty
CPU.

### RMA timeline

* Jan 15th: I receive the components for my new PC
  * In January and February, the PC crashes occasionally.
* Mar 4th: I switch back to my old PC and start writing my blog post
* Mar 19th: I publish my blog post about the machine not being stable
  * The online discussion does not result in any interesting tips or leads.
* Mar 20th: I order the AsRock Z890 Pro-A mainboard to ensure the mainboard is OK
* Mar 24th: the AsRock Z890 Pro-A arrives
* Apr 5th (Sat): started an RMA for the CPU
  * They ask me to send the CPU to orderflow, which is the merchant that fulfilled my order.
  * Typically, I prefer buying directly at digitec, but many PC components seem
    to only be available from orderflow on digitec nowadays.
* Apr 9th (Wed): package arrives at orderflow (digitec gave me a non-priority return label)
* Apr 14th (Mon): I got the following mail from digitec‚Äôs customer support and
  had to explain that I have thoroughly diagnosed the CPU as defective (a link
  to my blog post was sufficient):

> H√§ndler hat dies beim Hersteller angemeldet und dieser hat folgende Fragen:
>
> Um sicherzugehen, dass wir Sie richtig verstehen: Sie haben die CPU auf zwei
> verschiedenen Motherboards getestet und das gleiche Problem besteht weiterhin?
>
> K√∂nnten Sie uns mitteilen, welche Marke und welches Modell die beiden
> verwendeten Motherboards sind?
>
> Wurde auf beiden Motherboards die neueste BIOS-Version verwendet?
>
> Bestand das Problem von Anfang an oder trat es erst sp√§ter auf?
>
> Wurde der Prozessor √ºbertaktet? (Bitte beachten Sie, dass durch √úbertakten die
> Garantie erlischt.)

* Apr 25th (Fri): orderflow hands the replacement CPU to Swiss Post
* May 1st (Thu): the machine successfully passes stress tests; I start using it

In summary, I spent March without a working PC, but that was because I didn‚Äôt
have much time to pursue the project. Then, I spent April without a working PC
because RMA'ing an Intel CPU through digitec seems pretty slow. I would have
wished for a little more trust and a replacement CPU right away.

## Conclusion

What a rollercoaster and time sink this build was! I have never received a
faulty-on-arrival CPU in my entire life before. How did the CPU I first received
pass Intel‚Äôs quality control? Or did it pass QC, but was damaged in transport? I
will probably never know.

From now on, I know to extensively stress test new PC builds for stability to
detect such issues quicker. Should the CPU be faulty, unfortunately getting it
replaced is a month-long process ‚Äî it‚Äôs very annoying to have such a costly
machine just gather dust for a month.

But, once the faulty component was replaced, this is my best PC build yet:

{{< img src="IMG_5278.jpg" >}}

The case is the perfect size for the components and offers incredibly convenient
access to all components throughout the entire lifecycle of this PC, including
the troubleshooting period, and the later stages of its life when this PC will
be rotated into its ‚Äúlab machine‚Äù period before I sell it second-hand to someone
who will hopefully use the machine for another few years.

The machine is quiet, draws little power (for such a powerful machine) and
really packs a punch!

As usual, I run Linux on this PC and haven‚Äôt noticed any problems in my
day-to-day usage. I use [suspend-to-RAM multiple times a
day](/posts/2025-05-10-grobi-x11-monitor-autoconfig/#zleep) without any issues.

I hope some of these details were interesting and useful to you in your own PC
builds!
